# Unit Circle Game
###### Started 9/23/2018

  
### Project Description:
This is a web app written with HTML, JavaScript and CSS to help memorize and quiz understanding of the Unit Circle, or special angles. Upon the initial release, it features 4 different levels, degrees to radians, sine, cosine, and tangent. However, this code is easily changed to accomodate more questions or can even feature different questions entirely.

### Future Updates:
Create a local store database.

Create a drag and drop mode where the numbers are moved into their respective locations on the unit circle.
