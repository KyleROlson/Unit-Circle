### Project Description:
This is a web app written with HTML, JavaScript and CSS to help memorize and quiz understanding of the Unit Circle, or special angles. Upon the initial release, it features 4 different levels, degrees to radians, sine, cosine, and tangent. However, this code is easily changed to accomodate more questions or can even feature different questions entirely.

### Release:
The app can be viewed by going to circle.techykyle.com. It can also be used as a standalone app by adding it to the homescreen on both iOS and Android devices.

Update: Now available on the Google Play Store
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techykyle.circle

### Future Updates:
Create a local store database.

Create a drag and drop mode where the numbers are moved into their respective locations on the unit circle.

Save(cache) app to device.
